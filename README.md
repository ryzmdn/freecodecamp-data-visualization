# FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization Projects

I'm thrilled to have completed all the certified Data Visualization Projects from the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization), which use **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **D3.js**, and other front-end technologies. In this repository, I will share examples of the syntax and techniques used in the **5 projects** I've completed. You can use these examples to solve issues you encounter while working on your own projects.

## Projects in this Repository

1. **Visualize Data with a Bar Chart**: A bar chart representing historical data, such as GDP over time, with interactive tooltips and axis labels. [Demo](https://codepen.io/ryzmdn/pen/emOGKam)

2. **Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph**: A scatterplot graph depicting correlations between two data sets, such as performance over time. Includes zoom functionality and hover effects. [Demo](https://codepen.io/ryzmdn/pen/GgKMLoV)

3. **Visualize Data with a Heat Map**: A heat map to visualize variations across two dimensions, like temperature across months and years, with a color scale legend. [Demo](https://codepen.io/ryzmdn/pen/KwPyWdM)

4. **Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map**: A choropleth map that shows differences in data across geographic regions, such as educational attainment per state. Interactive tooltips display additional details. [Demo](https://codepen.io/ryzmdn/pen/EaYboxw)

5. **Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram**: A treemap diagram that shows hierarchical data through nested rectangles, ideal for displaying proportions, such as market share by company. [Demo](https://codepen.io/ryzmdn/pen/EaYbpwg)

## Features
